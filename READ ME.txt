This file server uses a directory server, replication and locking
The first storage server to connect to the network becomes the Primary manager. This is the only storage server that the client can write to.
The PM propagates the writes through to the replica managers who update their files and return an ack before the PM sends an ack to the client.
Locking takes place on the document when it is opened and the lock is released when the document is closed.

The clients have been implemented to each operate on different documents first, and then all attempt to operate on the same document.
The lock must be acquired before they can access the second document.
